                        <div>I believe in the standard works, and all that they mean. All the doctrines contained in 		the 4 standard works are true, and directly from God for our time period, and all time periods.
                        <div>I believe in Joseph Smith, and that he saw, and did everything he said he saw, and did. I know that he was chosen by God to do what he did for the whole world.
                        <div>I believe that reading is the best way to escape into a new world. Movies are great, but with books you yourself decide what the characters look like, and how the world looks in your mind.
                        <div>Learning is very important. There is something about learning that makes us humans so attracted to it.
                        <div>I believe in science. While it may not give all the answers, it has helped our world so much, and God gave it to us for a reason
                        <div>I believe that music is very important and, when used properly, can be a huge form of peace to all who listen to it.
                        <div>I believe that animals are a gift to us given from God. Not to be taken advantage of, but to be used for their respective purposes. Some to be eaten, and some to give us comfort and companionship.
                        <div>People are inherently good. It’s not our job to judge how others turned out, especially when we don't know the whole picture. Only God knows where every person started out and how far they have come. 
                        <div>I believe that God loves us. He’s never stopped, and never will. And someday we’ll fully experience His love

                                    Like most dads, has been a great mentor in my life. 
                                    He gave me some great advice about college, and how to prepare for the future. 
                                    One I really liked was this.He told me that “College is not the time for play. 
                                    You have plenty of time for that later in life.” In short, he was just saying that
                                    college is the time to study, and prepare for the future. He of course wasn’t meaning
                                    that we can’t have some fun, and enjoy ourselves every now and then. He was meaning 
                                    that we need to budget our time in such a way that having fun doesn’t overtake our time,
                                    and cause our school work to suffer. Because after all, that is the reason we are spending
                                    all this money to go to school! If we waste away our time here, and don’t take school seriously,
                                    that could potentially ruin the rest of our life.

                        I’m not someone who likes to be in the lime light, or be in the hot seat. I wouldn’t  
                        go as far as to say that I’m an introvert, I just don’t like bringing attention to myself. I’m totally fine 
                        with just sitting on the sidelines, and letting others take the spotlight. I have always been very laid back,
                        and patient person, but my mission was where I was truly gifted the gift of patience. I served in the Philippines, 
                        which meant that my companions would be Filipinos. People who barely speak English, and were raised in a very different
                        culture. And that was a huge hurdle for me at first. Filipinos are pretty different than Americans. And it took some 
                        getting used to. But with God’s help, I was gifted patience. And a lot of it. And the patient helped me be an 
                        understanding, and great companion to those I was assigned to serve with. It also helped in my marriage. My wife 
                        would get annoyed sometimes because I was so patient with her, and with other people. She would say things like 
                        “How did that driver cutting you off not annoy you?” or “How are you so calm right now, I’m freaking out!” 
                        (After we learned I needed to have an operation done on my heart for my WPW syndrome.) I don’t take any credit 
                        for my extreme patience, as it was truly a gift from God.

                            But there are of course are many things about myself that I need to improve on. One of those, is sometimes I have the tendency to rationalize my sins. 
                            There are times where I see someone else sin, and think “Wow I can't believe they did that". But then if I go and do that same sin, it’s all
                            the sudden totally ok, and I find some way to rationalize it. I don’t mean like huge terrible sins, but little things 
                            here and there. And the little things are what get us in the end! I try and rationalize things by thinking, “Oh, well, 
                            I’ve had a hard day, so it as ok that I didn’t pray at all, or that I didn’t read the scriptures at all this whole week. 
                            God will understand” But at the end of the day, sin is sin in the eyes of the Lord. No matter how big or small the sin is. 
                            And we are only hurting ourselves when we rationalize our sins, and don’t repent.

                                I’d read it a lot in seminary and personal study, and I knew it was true, but I had never sat down and read it cover to cover, and every single verse. 
                                But after I did, it reaffirmed my testimony of the gospel, and made me more excited than ever to be a missionary.</div>

                                    When someone does something that hurts or upsets me, I <span>try</span> to see them how God sees them. I try to give them the
                                    benefit of the doubt. Most people don’t just go around actively trying to ruin other’s lives, right? There is a very 
                                    small minority of people who do that. And the odds of us running into those people are very slim. So I try and see the motives, 
                                    or background behind an action. Sometimes, people don’t even know that they’ve offended us, or done something wrong. Or sometimes
                                    we’ve grown up in a different environment, so something that seems odd and strange to us, may seem totally normal to someone else. 
                                    So whenever I feel negative thoughts towards others, I try and step back and look at the big picture. Maybe this person was just 
                                    simple having a bad day, and I caught them at the wrong time. Or maybe they did something truly on accident, and I should forgive 
                                    them and give them the benefit of the doubt. And even if someone truly did something just to hurt me, or make me mad, then I will 
                                    do my best to forgive them, and pray for them.

                                I have been a team lead in one of my classes this semester, so being reliable is something 
                                I wanted to make sure I was, especially since I had many classmates relying on me to turn certain assignments in, and 
                                remind them about certain things. What I’ve done, is set an alarm for 5 minutes before our usually weekly meetings, 
                                so I can set up and get ready. I then set an alarm at 9pm, so I would make sure to turn in our assignments on time.

                                as easily as He gave it to me, He could take it away. What I’ve done is make sure to to thank Him every night. I 
                                also pray before doing any big labs or homework assignments, and ask for His guidance. This helps remind me that 
                                I need His help, and His guidance in my life.

                                in, even if I get ridiculed by other people’s replies. What they say doesn’t change the truth of the gospel!
                                So I’ve been trying to be better about that, and comment more often when the chance is placed before me.

                                years, I’ve been frantically learning how to code, while others around me have been 
                                programming for years and years.
                                Thank fully, my time on the mission helped me gain a work ethic that has allowed me to learn quick, 
                                and gain an internship! I know that without God’s help I wouldn’t have been able to get the internship, 
                                but God doesn’t just hand things to us without us doing anything. He 'fills in the gaps' so to speak. Where 
                                our knowledge and expertise ends, He does the rest. If we put the effort in, God will make things happen, 
                                and reward us with opportunities and blessings. (According to His plan for our life of course)
